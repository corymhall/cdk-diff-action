  stackSelectorPatterns:
    description: |-
      Comma delimited list of stack selector patterns. Use this to control which stages/stacks to diff. By default all stages & stacks are diffed

    required: false

  stackSelectionStrategy:
    description: |-
      Used in combination with "stackSelectorPatterns" to control which stacks to diff.

      Valid values are "all-stacks", "main-assembly", "only-single", "pattern-match",
      "pattern-must-match", "pattern-must-match-single"

      @default pattern-must-match if "stackSelectorPatterns" is provided, otherwise "all-stacks"

  diffMethod:
    description: |-
      The method to create a stack diff.

      Valid values are 'change-set' or 'template-only'.

      Use changeset diff for the highest fidelity, including analyze resource replacements.
      In this method, diff will use the deploy role instead of the lookup role.

      Use template-only diff for a faster, less accurate diff that doesn't require
      permissions to create a change-set.
    required: false
    default: change-set

    required: false
